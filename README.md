# Flaneur
An interactive application that allows users to build their own itinerary for various cities and generate a map with an optimzied route for those attractions. 
## Getting Started

To run this full-stacked application on your local machine, clone the Flaneur Repo (https://github.com/cpericak823/Flaneur.git)

### Prerequisites

Run npm install in the command line to install all the necessary modules

### Installing

Once you've installed all the modules, run the server.js file in Node to connect to your database

By visiting http://localhost:PORT (in this project, the PORT is either the one available in the Node environment or 3000), one is directed to this web app after connecting to the server.
